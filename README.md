# fits-analysis

A small tool to extract profiling information from FITS data.

The tar and gzip archive contains FITS results from running the FITS tool on a
single ARC file. An ARC file contains crawled characterisation data for several
hundreds web files. The FITS characterisation result for such a file is a set
of XML files, one for each web file. The profile information of a
characterisation job is in this case just defined as the difference in creation
time of the oldest and newest of the result files.

The tool outputs a line for each tar/gzip file in the given directory. Each
line has the following format:

    filename, count, length, time

where 

*filename*: The file name of the tar/gzip file

*count*: The number of web files contained in the ARC file

*length*: The file size of the tar/gzip file

*time*: The time difference in seconds between the oldest and the newest file in
the tar/gzip file.
